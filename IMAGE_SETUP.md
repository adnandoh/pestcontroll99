# Image Setup Instructions

To complete the setup of your PestControl99 website, you need to add the following images to the `public` folder:

## Required Images:

### 1. Logo Image
- **File name:** `logo.jpg`
- **Location:** `public/logo.jpg`
- **Recommended size:** 200x200 pixels (square format)
- **Description:** Company logo that will appear in the navigation bar
- **Format:** JPG format as specified

### 2. Hero Background Image
- **File name:** `heroimage.png`
- **Location:** `public/heroimage.png`
- **Recommended size:** 1920x1080 pixels or larger (16:9 aspect ratio)
- **Description:** Background image for the hero section showing pest control related imagery
- **Format:** PNG format as specified
- **Suggestions:** 
  - Professional pest control technician at work
  - Clean, modern home exterior
  - Before/after pest treatment results
  - Professional equipment or tools

## How to Add Images:

1. Navigate to your project folder: `pestcontrol99/public/`
2. Copy your `logo.jpg` file into the `public` folder
3. Copy your `heroimage.png` file into the `public` folder
4. Ensure the file names match exactly (case-sensitive)

## Image Optimization Tips:

- **Logo:** Keep file size under 100KB for fast loading
- **Hero Image:** Optimize for web (aim for under 500KB while maintaining quality)
- **Hero Image:** Ensure good contrast so white text remains readable
- **Logo:** Should work well on white background
- **Both:** Use high-quality images that represent your brand professionally

## Current Implementation:

The code is already set up to use these images:
- Logo appears in the header navigation
- Hero image serves as a background with overlay for the main hero section
- Both images are responsive and optimized for different screen sizes

Once you add these images, your website will be fully functional with professional branding!
